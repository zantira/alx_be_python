 #Python scripts: library_system.py and main.py. In library_system.py, youâ€™ll define a base class Book and two derived classes, EBook and PrintBook, showcasing inheritance. Additionally, implement a Library class demonstrating composition by managing a collection of books.

#Base class
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

#derive classes
class EBook(Book):
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str, file_size: int):
        super().__init__(title, author)
        self.file_size = file_size
    

class PrintBook(Book):
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str, page_count: int):
        super().__init__(title, author)
        self.page_count = page_count

#composing a class using Bool, Ebook and Printbook

class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        # if books is None:
        #     books = []
        self.books = []
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.books}"

    def add_book(self, book):
        return self.books.append(book)
    

    def list_books(self):
        for book in self.books:
            if isinstance(book, EBook):
                print(f"EBook: {book.title} by {book.author}, File Size: {book.file_size}KB")
            elif isinstance(book, PrintBook):
                print(f"PrintBook: {book.title} by {book.author}, Page Count: {book.page_count}")
            else:
                print(f"Book: {book.title} by {book.author}")







from library_system import Book, EBook, PrintBook, Library

def main():
    # Create a Library instance
    my_library = Library()

    # Create instances of each type of book
    classic_book = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen")
    digital_novel = EBook("Snow Crash", "Neal Stephenson", 500)
    paper_novel = PrintBook("The Catcher in the Rye", "J.D. Salinger", 234)

    # Add books to the library
    my_library.add_book(classic_book)
    my_library.add_book(digital_novel)
    my_library.add_book(paper_novel)

    # List all books in the library
    my_library.list_books()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
